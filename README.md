Pandeia-verification is a toolset for calculating sensitivity limits using Pandeia. 

Running the code:
The test/ folder contains scripts for each JWST instrument and mode. The code assumes the existence of an outputs/ folder. Pandeia must be installed 
separately, first.

INSTALLATION:

python setup.py install


Once pandeia is installed, and the outputs folder exists, instrument files can be generated by running the *_sensitivity_* scripts in the test 
directories. They write their outputs to .npz files that can be directly compared to older outputs from previous versions of the Pandeia 
code, and rely on code in verification_tools.

The code used to generate the public-facing plots from that data is held by Klaus Pontoppidan.
There is other code for plotting the sensitivity data in verification_tools.
