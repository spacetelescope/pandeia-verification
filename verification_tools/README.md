This folder contains code for generating the instrument comparison plots (compare_sensitivity.py) and bokeh interactive sensitivity plots (gather_*.py)

It also contains the generic helper scripts used by the tests (in tests/) to calculate sensitivities.

The generic tools and comparison plot codes cover both JWST and WFIRST.
